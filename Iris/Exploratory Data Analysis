What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
EDA is a process or approach to finding out the most useful features from a dataset according to your problem which helps you to choose the correct and efficient algorithm for your solution.

Why is Exploratory Data Analysis Important?
There are some prerequisites for every project and EDA is a prerequisite process for any data science or machine learning project. If you are in a hurry and skip EDA then you may face some outliers and too many missing values and, therefore, some
bad outcomes for the project:
1. Wrong model
2. Right model on wrong data
3. Selection of wrong features for model building.

How to do Exploratory Data Analysis?
We can do EDA with programming languages and data visualization tools.
The most popular programming languages are:
1. Python
2. R
The most popular data visualization tools are:
1. Tableau
2. Power BI
3. Infogram
4. Plotly
